Conversations parse data needed to get paginated.  We should move it to another storage.  Migration is often hard and requires overlapping write/read to not loose any data during transition.  In event sourcing, we'd spin up a new backend that keeps its projections in a relational database or a new format, and let it reread from the beginning of conversation events, including the ones occuring after it started.  When done, we take it live.  We don't even need to pull the old one down immediately either, we can have both running, listening to events and doing their own projections.
